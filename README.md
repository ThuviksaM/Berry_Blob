# RaspberryPi

This is all my code for my enviroment monitoring Raspberry Pi, feel free to explore around it! <a href= "https://io.adafruit.com/Thuviksa/dashboards/weather-monitor">Here</a> is my AdaFruit dashboard. Also, please contact me if you want to use my code. Note: My dashboard links to other dashboards, which are visible for you, too, so don't worry about that.

Thank you, <a href= "https://github.com/tproffen">@tproffen</a> for all the guidance and debugging help.
