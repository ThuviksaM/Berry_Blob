# Contributing

Hey, there ðŸ‘‹! I'm delighted that you want to commit to [Berry_Blob](https://github.com/ThuviksaM/Berry_Blob)!

When you contribute, I would like for you to [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) Berry_Blob and [pull request](https://github.com/ThuviksaM/Berry_Blob/pulls) when you're done, or directly pull request your changes, so that I can go over your changes and see if I need them in my code.
